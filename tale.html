<h2>BEGINNING</h2>
<br>
<p>The balete tree stood alone at the crossroads, its roots twisting like frozen snakes above the soil. No one remembered when it grew there. The elders only said that the road bent around it for a reason. Travelers avoided passing by after sunset, and tricycle drivers refused to stop near it once the sky darkened. Vernon moved to the barrio with his family at the start of the rainy season. City noise still rang in his ears, and superstition felt like an excuse for fear. When he first saw the balete, he laughed. It was only a tree—huge, yes, but lifeless. The warnings meant nothing to him. On his third night, Vernon walked home late. The moon hid behind clouds, and the air smelled of wet earth and tobacco smoke. As he passed the balete, a deep, gravelly laugh rolled through the branches. Above him, a massive shadow shifted, and burning red eyes opened in the dark.</p>

<h2>MIDDLE</h2>
<br>
<p>After that night, Vernon could not escape the presence of the tree. Wherever he went, the scent of smoke followed him. He dreamed of long limbs wrapped around the balete’s trunk and a voice that spoke slowly, with amusement, as if time meant nothing. Each evening, Vernin felt pulled toward the crossroads. When he resisted, accidents happened—bruises appeared on his skin, mirrors cracked, and his shadow sometimes moved a second too late. People in the barrio began to avoid him. They said he looked thinner, like something was feeding on him. One stormy night, Vernon finally returned to the balete. Lightning split the sky as a giant figure descended from the branches. The kapre towered over him, its skin black as ash, its mouth glowing red as it puffed from a massive cigar. It said the land remembered those who mocked it. The kapre had marked Lino the moment he laughed.</p>

<br>

<h2>END</h2>
<br>
<p>By morning, the storm had passed. Vernon never came home. His footprints ended at the roots of the balete tree, where the soil was scorched and warm. The road was later rerouted. Offerings were left beneath the tree—tobacco, matches, whispered prayers. At night, smoke still curled through the branches, and laughter echoed when travelers dared to look up. The kapre remained, patient and eternal, guarding the crossroads. And the balete tree continued to grow, fed by fear, memory, and those who forgot to believe.
