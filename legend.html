<hr>
<p style="color:white; font-family: Times New Roman;">The kapre is a mythical creature from Philippine folklore believed to live in large trees, especially balete trees. It is described as a tall, dark giant that smokes a cigar and watches over the land. Stories say the kapre tests humans, often targeting those who show disrespect or arrogance. The myth likely originated as a way to explain strange forest sounds and to teach people to respect nature and avoid dangerous places at night.</p>
